# WordFinder

**IDEA:**
  This program takes a large number of words (over 150,000) and places each word into a hash table. Then the user searches for a specific word.
  If found, it displays that the word was found and how much time it took to locate it in the hash table. In constrast, if the word in not found 
  the program will display to the user that the specific word could not be located.
  The idea is to find if a specific word is present within the large text as fast as possible.
